// This project is using typescript, which is a common version of javascript

// In order to get an output in iterm you need to use console.log
console.log("Show text in ouput")

// Variables are used to store information and then can be called for retrieval 
// This is the basis for how we manipulate data and then use it in other places
// In typescript the simplest way to declare a variable is using the let command

let firstName = "Emily";
let lastName = "Patrick";

// the variables that are being created are firstName and lastName and the value is your name
// we can then use those variables in place of the values for instance below 
console.log("Full Name: " + firstName + " " + lastName);

// we can also combine variables 
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
console.log(fullName)

// todo: create variables for an address and display it.
// variables should include street, state, zip code
